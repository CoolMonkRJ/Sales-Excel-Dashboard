📊 Executive Sales Dashboard (Excel)

This project demonstrates an executive-level sales analytics dashboard built using Microsoft Excel, designed to provide leadership with a one-page overview of sales performance.

The dashboard focuses on business decision-making, not just formulas.

🔍 Key Business Questions Answered

Which countries contribute the most to total revenue?

How concentrated is revenue across markets?

Are there seasonal patterns in sales performance?

Which product lines drive peak revenue periods?

How are deal sizes distributed across revenue buckets?

🧠 Key Insights

The USA is the dominant revenue driver, contributing nearly three times the revenue of the next largest market.

The top three countries account for the majority of total sales, indicating revenue concentration risk.

Sales exhibit strong seasonality, with consistent revenue spikes in Q4 across multiple years.

Classic Cars and Vintage Cars are the primary contributors during peak quarters.

Post-peak revenue decline suggests possible demand normalization worth further investigation.
